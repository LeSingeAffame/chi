At game start, the religions and faiths defined in this folder will exist.

== structure ==
religion_name = {
	doctrine = chi_doctrine_X

	faiths = {
		faith_A = {
			doctrine = chi_doctrine_Y 	# The faith will use this specific doctrine
		}
		faith_B = {
			# If you don't specify which doctrine to use, it will default on the one defined in the religion
		}
	}
}

== exemple ==
christianity_religion = {
	doctrine = chi_doctrine_none

	faiths = {
		insular_celtic = {
			doctrine = chi_doctrine_cultural_identity 	# The faith will use this specific doctrine
		}
	}
}

Most of the Christian Faiths will get the No Identity doctrine
Insular however will be set to have the Cultural Identity doctrine - it however cannot know here to which culture it should be tied, which has to be done in the chi_on_game_start on_action
